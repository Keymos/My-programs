# Thrive Program

## Description
A todo web app basically. The point is to learn flask, and other webdev technlogies needed for the project.
The main thing is the versatility and the ability for me personally to gather my data and analyse it seperately.


## Planned
**Tasks:**
what it should contain:
  - ~~id~~
  - mother task (if needed)
  - ~~title~~
    - add validation for title
  - ~~description~~
    - include duration
  - Repeat (y/n) â†’ on _[days]_ or _x_ times every _y_ * _u_ (units [days, weeks, months])
  - due time
    - ~~add the attribute~~ 
    - add:
      - If both date and time are empty, they both don't register
      - If only time is filled, then check if it is still not too late today, if yes, add today's date automatically
      - If only date is filled, then the time is automatically set to 00:00
  - reminder
  - reward (skill xp + pts)
  - skills
  - tags = categories (?)
  - sub-tasks
  - ~~status (done/no)~~

- Make is so that when clicking on a title, a page open up to edit the task
