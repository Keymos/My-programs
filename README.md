# Thrive Program

## Description
A todo web app basically. The point is to learn flask, and other webdev technlogies needed for the project.
The main thing is the versatility and the ability for me personally to gather my data and analyse it seperately.


## Planned
**Tasks:**
what it should contain:
- id
- mother task (if needed)
- title
- description
  - include duration
- Repeat (y/n) â†’ on _[days]_ or _x_ times every _y_ * _u_ (units [days, weeks, months])
- start time
- reminder
- reward (skill xp + pts)
- skills
- tags = categories (?)
- sub-tasks
- status (done/no)
