## Description and background
- The goal is to make a small web app to track some habits I have and want to keep track of. Aiming to do it in a week.

- Learning in parallel how to do everything needed, having, what I consider, a minimal sufficient theory of html, css, and js and some python background.

## Planned
- The interface should look something like:
-         1) Studying     [      ] hours
-         2) Working      [      ] hours
-         3) Working out  [V OR -]
-         4) Sleeping     [      ] hours
-         5) Eating       [      ] 
-         [Add Button] [Remove Button] [Submit Button]
- then a graph that updates on page refresh to the right of it.

**thinking about making each habit has its seperate file with the inputs in the form of date,data.**
